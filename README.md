## Task for Frontend Developer Role at Indiassetz

Create pixel perfect UI using React

- Figma Design - [Click here](https://www.figma.com/file/6bmldkdIgz1DWpGbRqSZIx/Admin-Dashboard?node-id=0%3A1&t=5Mcl7iJIkbSMmtml-1)
- Make sure all the designs are responsive 
- You can use any library of your choice for styling, but we prefer using [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/)

#### Bonus Points

- Setup Prettier and Eslint in your project
- Use [Formik](https://www.npmjs.com/package/formik) and [Yup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yup) for forms and validations
- Instead of pushing all of your code once on github, raise a PR for each design and then merge it by yourself
- Deploy the app on any platform like Netlify/Vercel
